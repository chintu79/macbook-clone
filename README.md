## 🧠 About The Project

This project is a creative attempt to **recreate a MacBook Pro** using **3D modeling and web animation**, powered by:

- **Three.js** through React-friendly wrapper (**React Three Fiber**)
- **@react-three/drei** for easy GLTF loading & scroll control
- **Framer Motion** / Tailwind CSS for UI enhancement

> The laptop **opens on scroll down** and **closes on scroll up**, creating an immersive hardware-inspired experience on the web.
